## ✨ Vision-Powered by Imagination + AI 🤖

> ❝ I imagined it. ChatGPT coded it. Together, we built a digital identity. ❞

Every line of code in this project was generated by **ChatGPT**, based on the **innovative prompts and creative direction I provided**.  
This is **proof-of-concept** that with vision and the right tools, you don’t need to be an expert to build something amazing.

I guided the AI with prompts like:
- “Create a glitching neon heading like in cyberpunk movies.”
- “Make a dark, animated background that looks like a digital circuit.”
- “Give me a cursor trail that glows like a laser.”
- “Design a contact form that feels part of the theme.”
